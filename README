# MediaConductor

MediaConductor is a software package designed for seamless, gapless video playback on Raspberry Pi and other Linux-based systems. It allows users to load video clips into specific folders for looped, triggered, or scheduled playback. The package provides a web-based backend interface for remote configuration and management.

## Features
- **Looped Playback**: Plays clips from a designated loop folder continuously.
- **Triggered Playback**: Plays a clip from a triggered folder upon receiving an external trigger.
- **Scheduled Playback**: Plays clips from a scheduled folder at specified intervals or times.
- **Gapless Playback**: Ensures no black screen or delay between clips.
- **Web Interface**: Manage video files and configuration settings remotely through a web browser.
  
## Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi** or other Linux-based systems
- **VLC Media Player** (for playlist control)
- **Git** (for installation)
